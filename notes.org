** Official docs: https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/manual/html_node/emacs/index.html
** Unofficial docs, might be better than official ones
*** https://tuhdo.github.io/ :helm:
** DONE Setup Straight.el ?
I have started looking into elisp seriously. Might be helpful to pull packages directly from Github
https://github.crookster.org/switching-to-straight.el-from-emacs-26-builtin-package.el/
** DONE Key bindings
*** I want to learn how to do move, copy, paste, and replace operations. Most of my time as a developer is spent on modifying text. I think I should be good at it
**** write a blog post because the best way to learn is to teach
**** DONE Join the evil side? Let's do it.
***** Pros
****** With vim, my left hand will be at more ease since I don't need to press C- for everything
***** Cons
****** Duplicating lines
******* It' 5 keys in emacs: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/88399/how-do-i-duplicate-a-whole-line-in-emacs
******* 3 letters in vim: https://www.vimfromscratch.com/articles/how-to-copy-and-paste-a-line-in-vim/
** TODO Setup Literate Programming for emacs.d?
** TODO Deft mode for searching the notes easily
*** https://github.com/jrblevin/deft
** DONE Setup helm mode - Settled on swiper instead
*** https://github.com/emacs-helm/helm
** TODO Setup lsp mode
*** https://github.com/snoe/clojure-lsp
*** Working config -> https://github.com/clojure-emacs/cider/issues/2747
** DONE Setup ivy mode
*** Ivy is a replacement for ido and isearch
*** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VvnJQpTFVDc
**** The fact you can see all isearch candidates on the same window is pretty cool.
**** I'm sure there is more to this package
** TODO How does emacs work under the hood?
Like org mode renders something but the actual typing is different. How is emacs able to handle this?
What is this concept called?

* Org Mode
** DONE Learn how to go into zen mode, ie. gutters on both ends
*** This looks promising https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti
*** This is also an option https://github.com/joaotavora/darkroom
*** DONE Chose darkroom, need to bind switching to a shortcut
**** Bound switching to darkroom to f1
**** DONE Move darkroom to straight.el
** DONE How to add metadata like date to specific headings?
:PROPERTIES:
:foo:      bar
:END:
*** Properties are added using the :PROPERTIES: key
*** Properties can be added to any headin
*** Docs: https://orgmode.org/guide/Properties.html
** DONE How to set custom fonts for org mode?
:PROPERTIES:
:completed_on: <2020-05-15 Fri 08:20>

*** https://zzamboni.org/post/beautifying-org-mode-in-emacs/
*** https://www.reddit.com/r/emacs/comments/9ksr43/set_different_fonts_in_org_mode/
*** Kinda done, but I realized that I like mononspaced color font
** TODO Add auto ids for headings
*** https://writequit.org/articles/emacs-org-mode-generate-ids.html
*** Auto ids will help you generate a graph in future
*** But since org mode can be easily parse, can't you just add ids later?
*** Well my friend, ids now will help you create roam like links
** TODO Try to figure out how agenda works
*** I have multiple todos in this TimeMachine folder
*** Learn how to enter Titles, Tags, and other metadata, using short cuts
*** My todos dont get metadata
*** Explore org as an inspiration to write the z-protocol
** TODO You'll probably need to Read the manual https://orgmode.org/manual/index.html
*** And while you are at it, maybe create blog posts so it makes learning for others easy
** TODO How to get images in org mode?
*** https://orgmode.org/manual/Images.html
** TODO How to add references?
** TODO How to convert a heading to a file?
*** Sometime I might write something, like in my journal, that deserves more attention. How do I convert that into a file?
** TODO How to generate table of contents?
** Make a personal guide to writing org docs
*** I want to ultimately publish everything here as a second brain
*** Find a way to handle private files and sections
*** Maybe start adding an id to all headings so it makes it easy to add internal links
** Making an item jump from one column to other

#+begin_quote
I solved it by using narrowing, just narrow the table to the single row with ~C-x n e~ and apply ~M-<Right>~ and then widen with ~C-x n w~.

There are dozens of Vim references online, but most of them either go ninja straight away, or start basic and don't go much deeper.
