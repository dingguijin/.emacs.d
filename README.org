#+TITLE: The software that transcends time
#+AUTHOR: Shivek Khurana


A few years ago, a co-worker adviced to get started with vanilla Emacs. It made a lot of sense because I was writing Clojure.
Emacs has now become my goto editor. I now understand the phrase, "Emacs has taken over my life".

This repo is my version of Emacs:
- It's mostly stable but a work in progress
- It'll probably always be like that
- Is very opinionated
- Is particularly suited to Clojure development
- Introduces minimal custom shortcuts
- Is on the evil-side due to objective reasons

* Key Features

** Project management using Projectile
Any directory with a ~.git~ folder is considered as a project. To open a project, just open a file in that directory using ~Cx Cf~. 
The project will then be cached and accessible via ~Cc Cp~.

** Sidebar using Neotree
Sidebar is bound to ~f8~ key. It is useful while trying to understand the structure of a new project.

** Focus mode using darkroom
Bound to ~f1~, focus mode helps with distraction free writing.

** Search using Swiper
Swiper is gem bound to ~Cs~. It makes the native search functionality 10x more awesome.

* Opinionated Features
- Straight.el for package management
- Powerline
- Dracula theme
- Org Journal for notes

* Things that can be improved
- Startup time
- Documentation


* Using this repo
In my early days, Github helped me learn from various public configurations. This config is designed to be barely vanilla.
It's best consumed by readin the source code and taking parts that interest you, or by reading my notes about how I use it.

[[./notes.org][Notes]]

The notes are not written in a publication form. You might find occasional typos and incomplete ideas, but should be helpful in general.
